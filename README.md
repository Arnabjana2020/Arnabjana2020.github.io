# A Quick Introduction to Salesforce

 You might think that Salesforce is just a CRM. It stores your customer data, gives you processes to nurture prospective customers, and provides ways to collaborate with people you work with. And it does all those things. But saying that Salesforce is “just a CRM” is like saying a house is just a kitchen. There’s a lot more to it than that.
 
 Salesforce comes with a lot of standard functionality, or out-of-the-box products and features that you can use to run your business. Here are some common things businesses want to do with Salesforce and the features we give you that support those activities.

 #### Get to Know Our Terms
 
 Perhaps you noticed a strange word in that last paragraph: objects. **Object** is one of many important terms you’ll learn as you get to know Salesforce.
 
 First, it’s important to understand what a **database** is in the context of Salesforce. When we talk about the database, think of a giant spread sheet. When you put information into Salesforce, it gets stored in the database so you can access it again later. It’s stored in a very specific way so you’re always accessing the information you need.
 
 Let’s take a look at a page from the DreamHouse app to define some of its important elements and how they relate to the database.
 - An **app** in Salesforce is a set of objects, fields, and other functionality that supports a business process. You can see which app you’re using and switch between apps using the App Launcher 
 - **Objects** are tables in the Salesforce database that store a particular kind of information. There are **standard object**s like Accounts and Contacts and custom objects like the Property object you see in the graphic.
 - **Records** are rows in object database tables. Records are the actual data associated with an object. Here, the 211 Charles Street property is a record.
 - **Fields** are columns in object database tables. Both standard and custom objects have fields. On our Property object, we have fields like Address and Price.
